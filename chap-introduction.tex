\section{Context and Objectives}

Robot motion planning is a crucial aspect of ensuring efficient and safe operation in dynamic, real-world environments. 
Robots are inevitably subjected to various uncertainties, such as external disturbances (e.g., wind), inaccuracies in their models, and errors in state estimation. 
Effectively managing these uncertainties is essential for robust and reliable robot behavior.

An effective approach to managing the complexity of robots operating in uncertain real-world environments is the decoupled planning and control approach. 
This process involves two main steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Planning Phase: A reference trajectory for the robot states and controls is planned based on available information, such as models of the robot and its environment.
  This step, typically executed offline, incorporates constraints (e.g., collision avoidance, limited actuation) and optimizes metrics like trajectory length or energy efficiency. 
  However, executing this planned trajectory in open-loop often fails in practice due to uncertainties affecting the planned reference.
  \item Control Phase: To ensure robust execution, a motion controller is employed to close the loop between the planned and actual motion, compensating for unforeseen effects and uncertainties that were not accounted for during planning.
\end{enumerate}
    
While this sequential approach, which separates planning and control, has proven useful, it exhibits significant limitations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Modern planners are able to generate feasible and globally optimal trajectories for high-dimensional kino-dynamical systems and complex constraints. 
  However, they typically ignore the role of the runtime feedback controller, leading to two key issues.
  First, the controller must deviate from the planned trajectory to address uncertainties and disturbances, which can quickly compromise feasibility and optimality.
  Then, the planner does not account for the robustness inherently provided by the controller, missing opportunities to generate more robust motion plans.
  \item While many adaptive and robust control schemes (e.g., H-infinity, LPV methods) have been designed to handle uncertainties and disturbances effectively, they are local to the vicinity of a reference trajectory. 
  These methods often fall short when it comes to addressing broader challenges such as feasibility under constraints, global optimality, and performance, which are better managed by global planning approaches.
\end{itemize}
    
To bridge the gap between the two communities, several approaches have been introduced, including less local controllers such as the well-known \gls{mpc}~\cite{cTMPC}. 
In addition, the past decade has seen the rise of so-called 'control-aware motion planning'~\cite{cTognon, cContractThMP, cMajundarLibrary}. 
However, these methods still face challenges related to generalizability, computational efficiency, and their reliance on potentially inaccurate models of the robot/controller pair due to model parameters uncertainties.

Therefore, this work, based on the 'control-aware motion planning' paradigm shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ca_strat}, leverages the closed-loop sensitivity concept~\cite{cPi,cTh} (an extension of the sensitivity notion that incorporates the controller behavior with respect to parametric uncertainties), in order to create robust control-aware motion planners applicable to a broad class of systems and controllers, while addressing uncertainties in their model representations.

\section{Thesis Outline}

This manuscript begins with a literature review in Chapter~\ref{chap:related_work}, providing an overview of the current state of the art. 
It initially focuses on decoupled approaches to robust motion planning, starting with path finding methods and progressing to kinodynamic planning.
The review then explores approaches that tackle the challenge posed by the presence of uncertainties, focusing on solutions at the motion planning level. 
It further discusses unified methodologies, referred to as control-aware planning techniques, which integrate motion planning with control strategies.
The chapter concludes with a focus on unified robust control-aware motion planning approaches, which form the main topic of interest.

Chapter~\ref{chap:models} introduces the \emph{closed-loop sensitivity} concept and presents how this concept can be leveraged to derive the so-called uncertainty tubes.
These uncertainty tubes are later employed in this thesis to impose robust constraints on systems while accounting for parametric uncertainties.
Then, this chapter presents the quadrotor and differential drive robot models considered in this thesis, along with their respective controllers and local planning techniques used for generating reference trajectories.

The first contribution of this thesis is then introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:samp}.
It presents the general method for integrating sensitivity-based uncertainty tubes into sampling-based planners to create various sensitivity-aware motion planner variants.
Furthermore, this chapter emphasizes the generation of sensitivity-optimal trajectories in global context.
Initial simulation results, using the models introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:models}, highlight that computing uncertainty tubes rapidly become a bottleneck for sampling-based motion planning methods.
To address this issue, a more efficient variant is proposed, leveraging a lazy collision-checking approach to reduce the need of uncertainty tube computations.

Chapter~\ref{chap:NN} introduces the second major contribution of this thesis, which leverages the structural similarities between ordinary differential equations and recurrent neural networks cells to accelerate the computation of sensitivity-based uncertainty tubes. 
A dataset generation method, based on sampling-based principle, is proposed and applied to the models discussed in Chapter~\ref{chap:models}. 
The method achieves an optimal balance between inference time and accuracy, making it highly effective for motion planning and showcasing the efficiency of the approach.

Chapter~\ref{chap:sampNN} aims to integrate the sensitivity-aware motion planning variants introduced in Chapter~\ref{chap:samp} with the deep learning approach described in Chapter~\ref{chap:NN}, resulting in a more efficient version of the sensitivity-aware motion planner variants.
Furthermore, while the previous chapters solely focus on generating robust and sensitivity-optimized trajectories, this chapter emphasizes the generation of task-specific accurate trajectories.
The effectiveness of this contribution is finally demonstrated through experimental validation on two challenging scenarios requiring high robustness and accuracy.
The experimental validation on complex tasks emphasize the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed framework in real-world scenarios.

Finally, Chapter~\ref{chap:concl} presents an overall conclusion that summarizes the contributions of this thesis along with their limitations.
Additionally, several perspectives are outlined to improve the generalizability of the proposed approach.
